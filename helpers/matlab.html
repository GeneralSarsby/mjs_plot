<h1>Matlab - MJSplot integration</h1>
<p>This is a quick and easy way to use MJSplot.js from Matlab. I find that Matlab's graph don't look that good, so I sometimes use MJSplots's high resolution .png export option for printing graphs.</p>
<p>A <a href="./MJSplot.m"><tt>MJSplot.m</tt> Matlab function</a>.</p>
<p>
This works like: <tt>MJSplot( data, captions, titlestr, xaxis,yaxis )</tt>. Where <tt>data</tt> is a cell array like <tt>{x y}</tt> or <tt>{x1 y1 x2 y2 ...}</tt>; <tt>captions</tt> is a cell array of strings (<tt>{'r8' 'r1'}</tt>);
<tt>titlestr, xaxis, yaxis</tt> are just strings. It will write a file called <tt>matlabplot.html</tt> into the working directory that is a full screen plot (scales to the size of the browser window).
You'll need a version of MJSplot.js in the working directory too.
The matlab internal web browser doesn't work with HTML5, so the best way is to right-click and pick 'Open Outside MATLAB'.</p>
