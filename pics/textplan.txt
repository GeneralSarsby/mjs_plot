pictures to get/make

SVG output.

Take graphs further
- Export graph as .svg to edit in Inkscape or Adobe CS
- We can't do everything. Use the tools you want.

Print your Graphs
 - 300 DPI images for crisp prints.
 - Anysize prints using the current size of the graph
 - Premade sizes for large and small figures.

Measuring
 - Gradients
 - time constants
 - powerlaws
 - works with a time axis: get results in /s /m /h /day 

Multi Touch
 - pinch to zoom/pan
 - quick zoom preview.
 
Time Axis
 - any scale between 0.001ms to 10 years
 - Unambigous, shows enough infomation without clutter.

Function Plotter
 - Drawn on-the-fly
 - Infinate canvas
 - Functions on a Time axis

Data Transformations
 - A stacking list of transformations
 - all common opperations
 - 1/x log(x) ln(x) exp(x) 10^x
 - smooth, y vs y, dy/dx, intergrate
 - jitter, subtract line
 - custom functions.
 - subtract fit, remove outliers.
 - and more!

Fullscreen graphs
 - great for phones*
 - overheads

*Non-Safari browsers until Apple implements the fullscreen API

Data Fits
 - Linear
 - Decays
 - Polys
Extrapolate fits to make predictions.

Data Export
 - Never get stuck
 - Even use MJS plot as a medium to 
share full graphs with just a link. 

Log Scales That work
 - Normal log
 - Zoomed in log
 - hyper logy view

Histograph Generator
 - auto binning, nice scales.
 - even on log axis
